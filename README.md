Predictive Maintenance System Using Gradient Boosting Classifier (95.29% Accuracy)

Our predictive maintenance system leverages the power of machine learning to accurately predict equipment failures before they occur. Utilizing a Gradient Boosting Classifier, the system analyzes sensor data from industrial machines—such as temperature, vibration, and pressure readings—to identify patterns that indicate impending failure. By employing advanced feature engineering and time-series analysis, the model can forecast failures with an impressive accuracy of 95.29%.

This high accuracy enables businesses to perform timely maintenance, reducing downtime, minimizing repair costs, and optimizing equipment lifespan. The model is trained on historical sensor data and validated using cross-validation techniques, ensuring robust performance across different machine types and operational conditions.
